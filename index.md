## Quantum Simulations for Phase Change Memories

This is a reaserch project I worked on during a graduate course I took during the final year of my undergraduate degree. You can view a paper which summarizes the result of my research [here](https://github.com/justinkang221/justinkang221.github.io/blob/master/dft_pcm_research.pdf)

## Fitness Tracking Using Machine Vision 

This is a group research project I competed as a "Capstone Project", which serves as an equivelent to a Thesis for Engineering Students in Canada. You can view a paper presenting the results of this project [here](https://github.com/justinkang221/justinkang221.github.io/blob/master/ENPH_459_Project_Summary.pdf)
