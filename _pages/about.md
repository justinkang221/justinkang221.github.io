Welcome to my website. You can find my <a href='publications'>Publications</a>, <a href='portfolio'>Projects</a> and <a href='files/Resume.pdf'>CV</a> above. Below, you can find some information about me.

* I am a Graduate Student at the University of California, Berkeley, supervised by <a href='https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kannanr'>Prof. Kannan Ramchandran</a>.
* Previously, I completed my Master's of Applied Science at The University of Toronto supervised by <a href='https://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~weiyu/'>Prof. Wei Yu</a>.
* My research interests include machine learning, privacy in learning, and data valuation. Recently, I've been applying some ideas from valuation/importance scoring to explainable AI for LLMs (see paper 1 below). I have a strong background in signal processing and information theory, and like to view these modern learning problems through that lens, which often leads to unique and exciting solutions.
* In 2019 I received my B.A.Sc. from the <a href='https://www.ubc.ca/'>University of British Columbia</a> in <a href="https://www.engphys.ubc.ca/">Engineering Physics</a>.

Recent News
======

* My paper *Learning to Understand: Identifying Interactions via the Mobius Transform* has been accepted to NeurIPS!
* A recent <a href="https://builtin.com/articles/what-is-federated-learning">article about Federated Learning</a> that I was interviewed for.
* I'm happy to anounce that my paper has won the <a href="https://www.itsoc.org/news/recipients-2024-ieee-communication-society-and-information-theory-society-joint-paper-award">2024 IEEE Communication Society and Information Theory Society Joint Paper Award</a>. This is one of two paper awards
* I'll be joining Google for summer 2024 as a Student Reseacher, working on a project with the Google Cloud Platforms Systems Research Group (SRG) hosted by Kun Lin and Prof. David Culler.
