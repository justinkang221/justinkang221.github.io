Welcome to my website. Below you can see some interesting projects I've been
working on.


Fitness Tracking Using Machine Vision 
=====


This is a group research project I competed as a Capstone Project. My friends and I, all of whom have a strong interest in fitness, as well as technology, saw the potential of machine learning to revolutionize the fitness industry. We worked on a machine vision system which can watch a subject and figure out which exercise they are doing, and give them feedback on what to do next. 


You can view a paper presenting the results of this project [here](files/ENPH_459_Project_Summary.pdf)

For this project, my team and I were awarded the *Bycast Award for Entrepreneurship* and the *UBC Design and Innovation Day Industry Award*.

Convolutional Encoder - From Theory to Layout
=====

One of my interests is implementing interesting algebra and information theory algorithms in hardware. I find it quite rewarding to see your research go on to be used in a physical product. This is why I chose to take a class in VLSI. This was great, because it gave me access to software that would otherwise cost thousands of dollars. 

In this project I designed and verified a convolutional encoder, as well as did layout out using Cadence tools. I was even able to design some of the standard cells myself. This was a great experience, because it combined my passion for information theory and my interest in hardware design to create something useful.
