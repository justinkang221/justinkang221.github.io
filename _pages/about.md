Welcome to my website. Below you can see some interesting projects I've been
working on.


Convolutional Encoder - From Theory to Layout
=====

One of my interests is implementing interesting algebra and information theory algorithms in hardware. I find it quite rewarding to see your research go on to be used in a physical product. This is why I chose to take a class in VLSI. This was great, because it gave me access to software that would otherwise cost thousands of dollars. 

In this project I designed and verified a convolutional encoder, as well as did layout out using Cadence tools. I was even able to design some of the standard cells myself. This was a great experience, because it combined my passion for information theory and my interest in hardware design to create something useful.
