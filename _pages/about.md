Quantum Simulations for Phase Change Memories
=====


This is a research project I worked on during a graduate course I took during the final year of my undergraduate degree. While working at Intel I became very interested in the physics of memory cells, and Intel's 3DXP memory in particular. Thus when I returned to school, and had the opportunity to pursue some independent research, this project came to be.

Work at Intel
======

Over my undergraduate degree, I've had the opportunity to spend 12 months working with an amazing group of research engineers at Intel. During my time there I worked on everything from hardware verification, to the cutting edge of information theory research. 

I was also selected as one of 10 employees to travel to Intel sites across America. I was able to meet some inspiring people along the way, and the trip motivated me to go after my dreams and take risks like Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore did 50 years ago when they went to go work for Dr. Schockley

Fitness Tracking Using Machine Vision 
=====


This is a group research project I competed as a Capstone Project. My friends and I, all of whom have a strong interest in fitness, as well as technology, saw the potential of machine learning to revolutionize the fitness industry. We worked on a machine vision system which can watch a subject and figure out which exercise they are doing, and give them feedback on what to do next.

For this project, my team and I were awarded the *Bycast Award for Entrepreneurship* and the *UBC Design and Innovation Day Industry Award*.

Convolutional Encoder - From Theory to Layout
=====

One of my interests is implementing interesting algebra and information theory algorithms in hardware. I find it quite rewarding to see your research go on to be used in a physical product. This is why I chose to take a class in VLSI. This was great, because it gave me access to software that would otherwise cost thousands of dollars. 

In this project I designed and verified a convolutional encoder, as well as did layout out using Cadence tools. I was even able to design some of the standard cells myself. This was a great experience, because it combined my passion for information theory and my interest in hardware design to create something useful.
