This is a group research project I competed as a Capstone Project for my undergraduate degree. My friends and I, all of whom have a strong interest in fitness, as well as technology, saw the potential of machine learning to revolutionize the fitness industry. We worked on a machine vision system which can watch a subject and figure out which exercise they are doing, and give them feedback on what to do next. 


You can view a paper presenting the results of this project <a href="https://justinkang221.github.io/files/ENPH_459_Project_Summary.pdf"> here </a>

For this project, my team and I were awarded the *Bycast Award for Entrepreneurship* and the *UBC Design and Innovation Day Industry Award*.
