Over my undergraduate degree, I've had the opportunity to spend 12 months working with an amazing group of research engineers at Intel. During my time there I worked on everything from hardware verification, to the cutting edge of information theory research. 

I was also selected as one of 10 employees to travel to Intel sites across America. I was able to meet some inspiring people along the way, and the trip motivated me to go after my dreams and take risks like Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore did 50 years ago when they went to go work for Dr. Schockley.
