This is a research project I worked on during a graduate course I took during the final year of my undergraduate degree. While working at Intel I became very interested in the physics of memory cells, and Intel's 3DXP memory in particular. Thus when I returned to school, and had the opportunity to pursue some independent research, this project came to be.
