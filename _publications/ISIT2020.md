Abstract: This paper considers a massive random access scenario where a small random set
of $k$ active users out of a larger number of $n$ total potential users seek to
transmit data to a base station. Specifically, we examine an approach in which
the base station first determines the set of active users based on an uplink pilot
phase, then broadcasts a common feedback message to all the active users for
the scheduling of their subsequent data transmissions. Our main question is:
What is the minimum amount of common feedback needed to schedule $k$ users in
$k$ slots while completely avoiding collisions?  Instead of a naive scheme of
using $k \log(n)$ feedback bits, this paper presents upper and lower bounds to
show that the minimum number of required common feedback bits scales linearly
in $k$, plus an additive term that scales only as $\Theta (\log\log(n))$. 
The achievability
proof is based on a random coding argument. We further connect the problem of
constructing a minimal length feedback code to that of finding a minimal
set of complete $k$-partite subgraphs that form an edge covering of a $k$-uniform
complete hypergraph with $n$ vertices. Moreover, the problem is also equivalent
to that of finding a minimal perfect hashing family, thus allowing leveraging the
explicit perfect hashing code constructions for achieving collision-free 
massive random access.
