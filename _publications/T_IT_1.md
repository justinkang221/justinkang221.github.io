Abstract:Consider a massive random access scenario in which a small set of $k$
active users out of a large number of $n$ potential users need to be
scheduled in $b\ge k$ slots.  What is the minimum common feedback to the
users needed to ensure that scheduling is collision-free? 
Instead of a naive scheme of listing the indices of the $k$ active
users in the order in which they should transmit, at a cost of
$k\log(n)$ bits, this paper shows that for the case of $b=k$, the
minimum fixed-length common feedback code requires only $k\log(e)$ bits,
plus an additive term that scales as $\Theta \left(\log \log(n)
\right)$.  If a variable-length code can be used, assuming uniform activity among
the users, the minimum average common feedback rate still requires 
$k \log(e)$ bits, but the dependence on $n$ can be reduced to
$O(1)$.  When $b>k$, the number of feedback bits needed for
collision-free scheduling can be significantly further reduced.
Moreover, a similar scaling on the minimum feedback rate is 
derived for the case of scheduling $m$ users per slot, when $k \le mb$.
Finally, the problem of constructing a minimum collision-free feedback
scheduling code is connected to that of constructing a perfect hashing
family, which allows practical feedback scheduling codes to be constructed from
perfect hashing algorithms.
